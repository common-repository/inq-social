InQ.Social helps you establish a dialogue with website visitors and apply what you learn to your marketing strategy. Our Interactive widgets ask visitors questions, track they responses and collect high-quality data points that help target marketing campaigns. With Inq.Social, drastically improve your site conversion rates and get ahead of the competition.

We offer three, key engagement services designed to cover all types of online activity that can be useful for marketing researchers and future retargeting.

**Interactive Widgets:** Ask questions, display rating requests and flash offers to capture customer feedback at the highest market click-through rates.

**Beacons:** Seamlessly track and record specific customer behavior for instantly related content delivery or future retargeting.

**Action Links:** Your very own 'Like' button. Track the way customers interact with your site and build precisely targeted audiences based on the data with our highly customizable Call to Action widget.

InQ.Social for WordPress makes it easy to integrate our services into any WordPress website. Just sign up for a free InQ.Social account at https://inq.social and create a WordPress website profile. Install the plugin and follow setup guidelines. 

InQ.Social widgets collect vast amounts of data throughout your site and send it to your very own, secure data cloud. You can then use our intuitive online tools to extract high-quality insights for your online marketing campaigns and push back special deals. For example, our Audience Builder lets you easily identify customers who replied to a question or performed a specific action and operate with these groups as distinct audiences in future marketing campaigns and reports.
